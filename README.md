# Megaventory-code-project

## Summary of the project:

* JavaScript and HTML were used for this project.
* Firstly, i read the data from the JSON file.
* Secondly, i created the clickable orders-list based on the items of the file.
* On the second page, i added the rest of the information asked for the Order and created a table for the OrderDetails dynamically.
* Finally, after completing the needed tasks i styled the pages with CSS to look a little better on the preview, and i deployed the website on GitHub Pages.
